# Mortality-Prediction
The study was conducted to compare National Early Warning Scoring (NEWS) System to identify the patient risk of mortality and develop a Deep learning model for the prediction of the risk of death. 
# Background:
Hospitalized patient mortality prediction is a significant issue. In recent decades 
for the prediction of hospitalized patient mortality, several scoring system and machine 
learning model has been developed. 
# Objective:
The study was conducted to compare NEWS1 and NEWS2 to identify the patient 
risk of mortality and develop a machine learning model for the prediction of the risk of death.
Methods: In this study, longitudinal data from 2019 to 2020, consisting of 2861 unique patient 
records was considered. Patients who stay in the hospital for more than 31 days are executed
from the research data, and the minimum age of the patients consider for this research is 16 or 
above 16. The deep learning model, Long Short-Term Memory, is employed for the prediction 
of mortality.
# Results:
Predictive model performance is evaluated using the area under the curve. NEWS1
(AUC 87-95%) show higher discrimination as compared to NEWS2 (AUC 85-94%). For the 
mortality prediction, the best result LSTM model achieved an AUC of 96%.
# Conclusions:
NEWS2â€™s improved version of NEWS1 does not show better results depending 
on the available features. The LSTM model provides better results with sequence data for the 
prediction of in-hospital mortality
